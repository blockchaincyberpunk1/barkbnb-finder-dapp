Tech Stack:

Ethereum: For deploying smart contracts that handle secure booking, damage deposits, escrow system for payments, and the automatic management of bookings and cancellations.
Solidity: The programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum. Web3.js  : JavaScript libraries for interacting with Ethereum blockchain from the web application.
Frontend:
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ideal for developing dynamic and responsive web applications.   Material-UI: For styling and quickly building a visually appealing interface.    Node.js: For creating a scalable backend service, useful for handling tasks that are not suited for blockchain, like private data handling or complex queries.
Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building the API.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing off-chain data such as user profiles, service listings not stored on the blockchain, etc.    IPFS (InterPlanetary File System): For decentralized storage, useful for storing images and documents related to listings without relying on traditional centralized cloud storage services.
MetaMask: A browser extension and mobile app that allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, necessary for transactions and smart contract interactions within your dApp.

Development Steps
Step 1: Setting Up the Blockchain Development Environment
Initialize a Hardhat Project: Navigate to the blockchain directory and initialize a Hardhat project by running npx hardhat.
Configure Hardhat: Edit the hardhat.config.js to include the Ethereum network settings and any other configurations needed.
Write Smart Contracts: In the contracts directory, create Solidity files (e.g., Accommodation.sol, PetCareService.sol) for your dApp's functionality.
Compile Contracts: Compile the contracts using Hardhat's compile command.
Testing: Write tests for your contracts in the test directory to ensure their correctness.
Deploy Scripts: Use the scripts directory to write deployment scripts for your smart contracts.
Step 2: Setting Up the Frontend
Create React App: In the frontend directory, initialize a new React application using create-react-app.
Integrate Web3.js: Install and configure web3.js to interact with Ethereum from your React app.
Setup Material-UI: Install Material-UI and set up a theme for your app in theme.js.
Build UI Components: Develop the UI components, pages, and routing needed for your dApp.
Step 3: Setting Up the Backend
Initialize Node.js Project: In the backend directory, initialize a new Node.js project with npm init.
Setup Express.js: Install Express and create a basic server setup in server.js.
Connect to MongoDB: Configure MongoDB connection and define schemas in the models directory.
API Routes: Implement the API routes in the routes directory, using controllers in the controllers directory for logic.
Step 4: Integration and Testing
Integrate Frontend with Smart Contracts: Use web3.js in your React app to interact with the deployed smart contracts.
Connect Frontend with Backend: Implement API calls from the frontend to the backend.
Comprehensive Testing: Perform comprehensive testing, including unit tests for smart contracts, frontend and backend integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
Step 5: Deployment
Deploy Smart Contracts: Use Hardhat to deploy your smart contracts to the Ethereum network.
Deploy Frontend: Deploy your React application to a suitable hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
Deploy Backend: Deploy your Node.js application to a server or a cloud provider like Heroku or AWS.
